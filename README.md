## Expressions
a statement but with and operator

### Basic Operators
```python
a=b         #declare value of a to be b
+a          #unary positve, does nothing
a+b         #sum or connect strings
-a          #unary negative, return negative a
a-b         #subtract
a*b         #multiply
a**b        #exponent, a to the power of b
a/b         #divide
a%b         #modulo, return remainder of a/b
```
### Bitwise Operators(not tested at all i think)
```python
<<          #left binary shift
>>          #right binary shift
&           #bitwise AND
|           #bitwise OR
^           #bitwise XOR
~           #bitwise invert
```
### Assignment Operators:
you can add a "=" with above operators to include assignment  
e.g.
```python
a+=b        #a=a+b
a**=b       #a=a**b
a<<=b       #a=a<<b
```
### Boolean Operators
return 1 or ```True``` if is correct
```python
a<b         #less than
a>b         #greater than
a<=b        #less than or equal to
a>=b        #greater than or equal to
a==b        #equal to
a!=b        #not equal to
```
### Logic Operators
```python
a and b     #return True only when both a and b is True
a or b      #return True as long as a or b is True
not a       #return opposite of a
```

## Data Type
### Type casting
